Fortunately, I’m one of those people, who isn’t affected by what others have to say, and always trust in my guts. I firmly believe the fact that one’s opinion about me isn’t my reality and this keeps me going. Luckily, I've been a naturally gifted individual from the start even in college while most of the students struggled with speaking out and sharing their thoughts and interests/preferences, I felt that unlike others. Likewise, I have always loved to know others and their opinions despite of the cultural or religious differences. I believe, Communication is the key to understand and to be understood.
I'm a really fast learner and I have my fair share of both fun and studies. And I have stood out among others. However it’s never that stress-free to do what you want. Being a girl and coming from the underdeveloped region of Pakistan, it’s hard to be yourself because of the judgmental society. I remember when I chose software engineering over the most preferred field of medicine, how much criticism I went through. I know IT is the future but unfortunately people here don’t. They think of my future to be a so-called housewife only. Nonetheless I don’t want and I can’t make their conviction my reality. My strong will to prove myself is my ultimate strength. I know what my field has to offer me and reaching those heights is my vital goal now.
USA is undoubtedly the most developed country and getting there would be no less than a milestone. I want to opt this opportunity to do more in my career path and prove myself that the decision I made to become a software engineer was worth it.
